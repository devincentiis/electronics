# Water Flush Muse - water waste tank alarm
This is an ATtiny412 based alarm, the circuit diagram and firmware are designed to work for a long time with a CR2032 lithium battery. It can also be used as a simple flood alarm using a normally open float and setting the timer to zero.
The low battery warning is performed with a single beep and a flash at each discharge.
